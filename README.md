# KeepWastes 
The best open-source application for keeping your money wastes on C#

# Why was it created?
I have to write a lot of money wastes to track my budget on my Phone. I've found 2 best apps for solving this problem for iOS and Android: 
>`iOS:` [MoneyFlow](https://itunes.apple.com/RU/app/id900890647)
>
>`Android:` [1Money](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pixelrush.moneyiq&hl=ru)

When I tried to find a **GOOD** similar app for Windows, I was a little bit confused. So, KeepWastes is going to change it!
